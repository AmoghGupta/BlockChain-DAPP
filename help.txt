TRUFFLE FRAMEWORK
npm install -g truffle
## install truffle which allow us to create ethereum DAPPS on ethereum network
## it give us set of tools to write smart contracts in solidity programming lang
## deploy smart contract to blockchain
## testing smart contracts
## write client side app using truffle

GANACHE
## LOCAL MEMORY blockchain FOR DEVELOPEMEMT PURPOSE
## LOCAL blockchain 

METAMASK EXTENSION
## PLUGIN HELPS IN CONNECTING BROWSER TO blockchain 




# this provides a boilerplate code to start faster
truffle unbox pet-shop

commands:
truffle migrate (for deploying smart contracts)
truffle console (gives us a truffle console to work with smart contract)




// here we are getting information about the Election smart contract
// which we deployed and storing in a 'app' varibale
// promise concept being used
Election.deployed().then(function(instance){app = instance})

// gives all accounts connected in the network
web3.eth.accounts
web3.eth.accounts[0]

transaction receipt
whenver we write(do any activity on) the blockchain we are actually creating transactions and the transactions are grouped
into blocks which are chained together to create a blockchain. whenver we do a new transaction
we get a transaction receipt

//GAS
ethereum network determines the concept of gas i.e whenever a user
writes on a blockchain it will cost him gas
reads are free on blockchain
// gas is a unit 
// gas usage * gas price = ethereum
